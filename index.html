            <h2>Week 1 Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                This week I wanted to establish a strong foundation of knowledge in the core aspects of LLM chat's focus. 
                I focused on augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, the role of AI in AAC innovation, and the barriers
                d/Deaf and Hard of Hearing people face in video conferences (VC).
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent much of my time focusing on AAC devices. I found Curtis et al.'s 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3517428.3544810">State of the Art in AAC: A Systematic Review and Taxonomy</a> 
                helpful in identifying broad trends. It discusses the types of 
                input and output AAC devices used and which were most common. The same report also identified traits for AAC that are key in 
                continued use, mainly customization and automation, however a lack of adaptability leads to abandonment. With a greater understanding of the 
                geography of AAC technology, understanding AI's impact is more significant. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For the purposes of our research, AI use seems particularly significant in two areas. The first is its application in predictive text,
                which allows users who interface through a keyboard to more quickly type longer sentences. Second is AI's ability to identify context,
                which can include setting or dialogue partner.
            </p>

            <p>
                My research on DHH difficulties in VC was not as in depth.
                I plan to focus more on this topic in the coming days. I found a theme of VC software to be extremely audio-centric. 
                Spoken conversations frequently happen at a speed that makes using the chat as an active participant unfeasible.
                When hybrid meetings take place, many difficulties of VC are compounded.
